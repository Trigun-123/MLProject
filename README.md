# 📖 Book Popularity Prediction
**Book Popularity Prediction** is a data-driven machine-learning project focused on predicting book popularity from metadata and user reviews.  
It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model pipelines, and deployment-ready artifacts.  

## ✨ Features  
- 📚 **Dataset** includes book metadata (`book_data.csv`) and cleaned version (`book_data_cleaned.csv`)  
- 🧼 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** to handle missing values, outliers and categorical encoding  
- 🤖 **Model Pipelines** built using linear regression and random forest (`book_popularity_lr_pipeline.pkl`, `book_popularity_rf_pipeline.pkl`)  
- 📈 **Model Evaluation & Comparison** in the notebook: accuracy, RMSE, feature importance  
- 🗂️ **Pickle-serialized Models** for quick inference and deployment  
- 🧪 **Exploratory Analysis** documented in the Jupyter notebook (`book_popularity_prediction.ipynb`)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **scikit-learn** for modeling and pipelines  
- **Pickle** for model serialization
